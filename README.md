This is a small project which i have develped while learning Node js with MongoDB.
It is a bloggin website which can store the diary on particular date and we can search that data in order to retrive the content of that date. The main page consist of few diary entries each of min of 100 letters.
This is not hosted anywhere at. Once its hosted i will update the code and URL of the website.
